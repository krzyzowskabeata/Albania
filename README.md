# Albania

Albania was created within four days time as a web solution for tourists visiting Albania.

Project gives an opportunity to log in and plan unique trip among Albanian country. It was split into two parts. The first one gives an opportunity to choose destination points depending on "Where to go?" reasons. Secondly, we may make a choice depending on "What to do?".

Albania project was created with the use of React and JavaScript knowledge. The CSS sheet was generated using Sass (whole project split into partials). For the proper working of web application the JSON server and React's fetch method were used (to present all destination points, create user's unique plans, modify them or to attach a personal note, which can be available and modified later). The project was provided with additional conditions helping the user not to double once added destination points or not to remove the ones with personal note etc. All work was performed with npm package manager, Webpack module bundler and Git control system.
